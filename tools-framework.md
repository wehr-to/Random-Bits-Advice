# this is a personal framework I use whenever I attempt to learn a new tool

# 1: What Problem Does This Tool Solve?
- What purpose does it serve in your system?
- What risk, pain point, or gap does it eliminate?
- Why did you choose this over other tools?

#2: How Did You Build This?
- How was it installed or deployed (manual, Docker, Ansible, etc)?
- What are key files, commands, or architectural choices?
- What was the order of operations?
- Where did you diverge from defaults? Why?

#3: Why Does This Configuration Matter?
- What specific config settings (flags, policies, env vars) are security-relevant?
- What’s hardcoded that shouldn’t be?
- Which choices enforce least privilege or fault tolerance?
- Example: Talk about parameters, not just tools, why did you tune that timeout, or deny all except port 22?

#4: How Does It Connect to the Rest of the System?
- What are its inputs and outputs (data, logs, ports)?
- Where does it sit in your network (VLAN, firewall zone)?
- What other services does it rely on?
- Example: Name the dependency chains clearly, if this goes down, what breaks?

#5: How Would This Break in Production?
- What’s the most fragile or insecure part?
- What happens if the container crashes, the log volume fills, or a cert expires?
- What single points of failure or privilege escalation risks exist?
- Example: Identify runtime risks, not just install risks.

#6: What Would I Tweak or Harden in Production?
- What needs to be more scalable, secure, or automated?
- Would you switch to cloud-native storage, external auth, or rate limiting?
- How would monitoring, backups, or recovery look?
- Example: Mention what works locally but wouldn’t fly in prod.

#7: How Would I Explain This to a CISO or Interviewer?
- What’s the “value prop” in 30 seconds?
- What risk does this reduce?
- How does this align with frameworks like NIST, CIS, or MITRE?
- Think: Less technical, more impact-oriented.

# 8: What Did I Learn or Struggle With?
- What was tricky to figure out?
- What did you break and fix?
- What docs or commands helped you get unstuck?
- Note: This is your real proof-of-work log. Show your learning curve.

#9: What’s Missing or Next?
- What still needs testing, tuning, or documenting?
- Are you missing visibility, alerting, or disaster recovery?
- Is there an adjacent tool or feature you should build next?
- Note: Turn gaps into action items for your roadmap.
